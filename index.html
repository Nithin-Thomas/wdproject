  <p>Is <em><strong>Sherlock's </strong></em>mind palace possible?</p>
  <p><em>No. The kind of mind palace portrayed in Sherlock isn't possible for a normal person.
      Like most things on TV, they don't work that way in real life.
      The technique that the mind palace is based on has been known for thousands of years at least,
      but it is only really suited to recalling lists of items.</em></p>
